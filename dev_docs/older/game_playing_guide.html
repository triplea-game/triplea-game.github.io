<h2><a id="sec_1">1.0</a> Installing TripleA</h2>
<p>
	Installing TripleA consists of three basic steps that can be carried
	out under all platforms easily. They consist of:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.triplea-game.org">Downloading TripleA</a></li>
	<li>Unzipping TripleA</li>
	<li>Running TripleA</li>
</ol>
<p>
	There are, however, only one prerequisite that one needs to fulfill
	before being able to install TripleA properly. All persons intending
	play TripleA must have a Java Virtual Machine (known as well as the JRE
	(Java Runtime Engine)) installed.
</p>
<p>
	TripleA is made to run with any Java Virtual Machine that is compliant
	to the Sun Microsystem's Java Technology. TripleA is also pre-built using
	Sun's Java 1.4.2 technology. So running TripleA on Java technology that
	does not comply to Sun's standards may not work. TripleA has been tested on
	several Java VMs such as BlackDown and the SGI and Mac OS X's ports of Sun's
	Hot Spot VM.
</p>
<p>
	As of TripleA version 0.5.2 and upwards, you can use either Java 1.5 or Java
	1.4 to run TripleA. So downloading and installing either Java VM from Sun is
	entirely up to you to decide. Below a links provided to download Java; please
	note that you only need the <b>J2SE JRE</b> package. Only developers and others
	who wish to compile TripleA from source need only get the <b>JDK</b> or <b>SDK</b>
	packages.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html" target="_blank">Sun Java 1.5</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/download-138376.html" target="_blank">Sun Java 1.4</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011012723/http://www.apple.com:80/macosx/features/java/" target="_blank">Java 1.4 for Mac OS X</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sgi.com/products/?/6.5_java_plugin_1.4.1_06/" target="_blank">Java 1.4 for SGI/IRIX 6.5</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="sec_1.1">1.1</a> Microsoft Windows</h2>
<p>
	Assuming that you:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have installed Java</li>
	<li>Downloaded TripleA</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We can proceed to installing TripleA under the Windows platform. TripleA comes
	packaged in a compressed Zip file. You will need to extract the contents of the
	TripleA zip file somewhere on your computer (it really doesn't matter where). You
	will need a program to unzip the TripleA zip file. Most windows systems come with
	built-in zip file support which makes a zip file look like a folder with a zipper
	icon on it. For those persons who can see this, they may simply double click on the
	TripleA zip file and Windows will take over from there asking you where to unzip the
	contents of the file.
</p>
<p>
	For those persons who do not have built-in zip file support of do not wish to use
	Windows's zip file support, can use several other programs. There are several freeware
	programs such as <a href="http://www.winzip.com" target="_blank">WinZip</a> and
	<a href="http://www.rarlabs.com" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> that allow you to zip and
	unzip files (and more!). So installing either one of those packages will allow you
	to unzip the TripleA zip file.
</p>
<p>
	Once TripleA has been successfully unzipped/extracted to a specified area on the computer.
	It doesn't really matter where TripleA is extracted to, so long as you know where it has
	been extracted to, it's all that matters. Find the folder where TripleA is located. By
	default the folder name should mirror the name of the TripleA zip file:
	<br>
</p>
<table class="thickTable" style="width: 650px; height: 100px;">
	<tr>
		<td style="height: 10px;"><b>File Name</b></td>
		<td style="height: 10px;">-> <!-- &#8674; --></td>
		<td style="height: 10px;"><b>Folder Name</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background-color: #ffb6c0;"><b>triplea_x_x_x.zip</b></td>
		<td>Would extract a folder named</td>
		<td style="background-color: #8fee8f;"><b>triplea_x_x_x</b></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>
	Go inside the TripleA folder using Explorer and you should see a file named
	<b>triplea_windows.bat</b> or if you have Windows configured to not display
	file extensions then you will see <b>triplea_windows</b>. This is a MS-Batch
	file which will run the TripleA start-up command in the Microsoft Console.
	Double Click on that file and TripleA will run.
</p>
<h2><a id="sec_1.2">1.2</a> GNU/Linux, SGI/IRIX, Mac OS X</h2>
<p>
	Assuming that you:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Have installed Java</li>
		<li>Downloaded TripleA</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	We can proceed with installing TripleA on the Linux, Irix, or Mac OS X platform.
	TripleA is packaged in a compressed zip file, to which most Unix based systems
	provide useful unzipping utilities such as the <b>unzip</b>. This is a command
	line program which is run from the console/terminal. There are others that have
	a graphical user interface but they vary from different platforms. Since <b>unzip</b>
	is common to all three Operating Systems mentioned above for this section, we shall
	focus on it.
</p>
<p>
	Open the console/terminal for your platform. Go into the directory you have saved
	the TripleA zip file in. From there, run the following command:
</p>
<br>
<br>
<pre><code>unzip -L triplea_x_x_x.zip</code></pre>
<br>
Once TripleA has been successfully unzipped/extracted to a specified directory on the computer,
you are now ready to run it. The unzip command above would have extracted TripleA to the current
directory you are in. So you would see a folder of TripleA by the same name as the zip file.
<br>
<br>
<table class="thickTable" style="width: 650px; height: 100px;">
	<tr>
		<td style="height: 10px;"><b>File Name</b></td>
		<td style="height: 10px;">-></td>
		<td style="height: 10px;"><b>Folder Name</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="background-color: #ffb6c0;"><b>triplea_x_x_x.zip</b></td>
		<td>Would extract a folder named</td>
		<td style="background-color: #8fee8f;"><b>triplea_x_x_x</b></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
Go inside the TripleA directory and list all the contents inside:
<br>
<br>
<pre><code>cd triplea_x_x_x<br>ls</code></pre>
<br>
You should be able to see a listing of the directory contents inside the
TripleA directory, an example is shown below:
<br>
<br>
<pre><code>bin/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doc/&nbsp;&nbsp; lib/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triplea_mac_os_x.sh<br>changelog.txt games/ license/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triplea_unix.sh<br>classes/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icons/ readme.html triplea_windows.bat<br></code></pre>
<br>
<p>
	From here you will need to execute the shell script file that suits your operating
	system. If you are running Mac OS X then you will need to run the <b>triplea_mac_os_x.sh</b>
	script, and if your running GNU/Linux, SGI/Irix or any other UNIX variant then you must
	run the <b>triplea_unix.sh</b> file. Before attempting to run them, you will need to change
	the file permissions first (this applies to both Macs and Unix). Below are both the commands
	to change the file permission and the command to run it:
</p>
<br>
<br>
<pre><code>chmod +x triplea_unix.sh<br>./triplea_unix.sh</code></pre>
<br>
<p>
	Thats all there is to running TripleA!
</p>
<h2><a id="sec_2">2.0</a> The Main User Interface</h2>
<p>
	TripleA's user interface consists of a collection of 1 or more tabs. By default there
	are 2 tabs present: <b>Game</b> and <b>Properties</b>. The game tab gives a brief
	description of what game your running and what engine version your using. This being
	said, the game tab is divided into 3 sections: <b>Game Type</b>, <b>File</b>, and
	<b>Version</b>.
</p>

<p>
	Every game will have a properties tab where an arbitrary number of property
	options are available. Usually these options will somehow affect how the game
	will be played. Once a game file is loaded, the properties tab will appear. In
	TripleA's case, it will remember the last game file you loaded so there will
	always be a pre-loaded game file, thus the properties tab will show under any
	circumstance.
</p>
<p>
	Below are provided 2 screen shots of the how the properties tabs would look like
	in TripleA if the World War II v1 Classic Edition (Fig 2.0.3) and World War II v2 Revised Edition (Fig 2.0.4)
	were selected. These are just examples, some games might have more or less options.

<h2><a id="sec_2.1">2.1</a> Local Game</h2>
<p>
	A local game is one where you play a game alone and by your self. There are not
	any computer opponents to go against. All sides are played by 1 person (you).
</p>
<p>
	To start a local game you need to:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start up TripleA</li>
	<li>Select "Local Game" from the <b>Game Type</b> menu</li>
	<li>Select the game to be played from the <b>File</b> menu</li>
	<li>Clicking on the <b>Play</b> button at the bottom of the main window</li>
</ol>
<p>
	As usual, to quit TripleA from this stage, press the <b>Exit</b> button.
</p>
<h2><a id="sec_2.2">2.2</a> Server Game</h2>
<p>
	A server game is one where you are playing a multiplayer game where the person
	initiating the game is acting as the server. The server is responsible for hosting
	the game where multiple clients (other players running "Client Game") can connect
	to the server. The server also has the ability to select property options from the
	properties tab and is the only one able to save the game. Below are the steps needed
	to get a server game running:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start up TripleA</li>
	<li>Select "Server Game" from the <b>Game Type</b> menu</li>
	<li>Enter the server name in the "Server Options" dialog box</li>
	<li>(optional) Enter the server port number</li>
	<li>Click on the "Server" tab to allocate players</li>
	<li>Click on the <b>Play</b> button to start the game</li>
</ol>

	<br>
	Click the <b>Play</b> button and get ready to play!
</p>
<h2><a id="sec_2.3">2.3</a> Client Game</h2>
<p>
	A client game is one where you wish to join (connect) to a person who is creating a server
	game. To put it in more simpler terms, you want to join a game that someone is hosting. This
	requires one to start TripleA as a "client" or rather start a "Client Game." The steps needed
	to start TripleA as a client and connect to a dedicated server can be described in 4 steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start up TripleA</li>
	<li>Select "Client Game" from the <b>game type</b> menu</li>
	<li>Enter your name and server address in the client options</li>
	<li>Click on the "Client" tab to pick your national side</li>
	<li>Wait for the server to start the game</li>
</ol>
<p>
	<b>Step 3.</b><br>
</p>
<table class="thickTable" style="width: 700px; border: none;">

					<td style="background-color: #ffcc99;"><b>Server Port</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>
						The IP address of the server is needed for the client to connect
						to the server. This is essential to most things in everyday life
						as well. To get to a destination, one must need to know where it
						is located. On the Internet we have the IP address as our location.
						The server should provide you with their IP address in order for
						you to connect as a client.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="background-color: #ffcc99;"><b>Server Address</b></td>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	<b>Step 4.</b><br>
	<br>
	Once connected to the server you will be faced with a chat window (Fig 2.3.1) and the main
	TripleA start-up window. Two things will be changed from the main TripleA window
	at this moment:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The properties tab will be removed</li>
	<li>A client tab will appear (Fig 2.3.2)</li>

<p>
	<b>Step 5.</b><br>
	<br>
	Wait for the server to start the game.
</p>
<h2><a id="sec_2.4">2.4</a> Play By EMail Game (PBEM)</h2>
<p>
	TripleA's Play By EMail mode allows persons to play a game via EMail without having
	to be connected to each other online. PBEM also allows players more time to think over
	various moves they have to do and ideal for those persons who live under strict time
	constraints, and cannot spend hours and hours online playing games.
</p>
<p>
	TripleA's PBEM mode has advantages and disadvantages, to which the advantages out weigh
	the latter. They are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Advantages of PBEM
		<ol>
			<li>More time to think out moves</li>
			<li>Only need to come online to send your turn to the next player</li>
			<li>Dice rolls are done by a dedicated dice server that is independent of TripleA</li>
			<li>All dice rolls are PGP Verified and email to every player</li>
			<li>Every move and every dice roll is logged and saved in TripleA's History Window</li>
			<li>An online game can be later continued under PBEM mode</li>
			<li>Hard for others to cheat</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Disadvantages of PBEM
		<ol>
			<li>Cannot save and mail your turn while in the middle of a battle sequence</li>
			<li>Casualties for both sides during a battle must be selected by the person currently playing</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	A PBEM game can be initiated in 10 steps shown below:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Start up TripleA</li>
	<li>Select "PBEM" from the <b>game type</b> menu</li>
	<li>Select the PBEM saved file that an opponent sent you
	    or begin a new PBEM game, from the <b>file</b> menu</li>
	<li>Click on the "PBEM" tab</li>
	<li>Enter the email addresses of the persons involved in the PBEM game (including your own)</li>
	<li>Click the "Test EMail" button to make sure the Dice Server is up and running and
	    that the emails you entered are valid.</li>
	<li>Start the game by pressing the <b>Play</b> button</li>
	<li>Play your turn</li>
	<li>Save your game at the end of your turn</li>
	<li>EMail your saved game to your opponent</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Here are some "Practical Guidelines" for playing PBEM with TripleA
	that has been contributed by the <a href="#" target="_blank">TripleA PBEM community</a> (Link unavailable).
	They address certain issues such as what to do during battles and file naming conventions.
</p>
<h3>Practical Guidelines for PBEM</h3>
<p>
	Playing TripleA over the net allows for continuous game play. With it, you don’t
	need five or six hours dedicated to one game. You can participate in a game whenever you can.
	You can even start a game via the Client / Server model and continue it via PBE.  You can exchange
	the save game file via instant messenger, FTP server, or email and pick it back up in a Client /
	Server game whenever you can.  Here are some general guidelines to help you keep your game play going.
</p>
<h4>Selecting Casualties</h4>
<p>
	When selecting casualties you should follow an agreed guideline.
	A common guideline is to select casualties according to the cost of the piece.
	For land units it would follow this order:  Infantry, Artillery, Armor, Fighters, Bombers.
	When losing a bomber in a land battle it would do well to consider the interest of your opponent.
	If you would lose the bomber before a fighter to hold onto the territory then do that with your opponent’s
	best interest in mind
</p>
<p>
	Continuing the example for sea battles, casualties would be selected in this order:  Transports, Submarines,
	Fighters, Destroyers, Loaded Transports, Carriers, Battleships.  Submersible submarines give exception; if a
	submarine is by itself or with empty transports then it submerges on the first round.
</p>
<h4>Types of PBEM play</h4>
<p>
	<b>Standard PBEM</b>: this kind of game is described in the TripleA documentation.  You select the PBEM option
	and enter your email address and your opponents email address.  If there is more than two involved in the
	game you enter your email address and the email address of the person whose turn follows yours.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Confirmable PBEM</b>: we use this kind of game to keep the game easy on our inbox.  You select the PBEM
	option but you use the groups email address.  Create one email address for your group and send all dice
	rolls to that address (use it for both email fields).  The group moderator should have the password to
	this email account.  This way dice rolls can still be confirmed if they are called into question and no
	inboxes get flooded with dice results.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Trust Game</b>:  In this game we do not use the PBEM option.
</p>
<h4>Naming Schemes</h4>
<p>
	Once your turn is complete you send the save game file to the other players. It is helpful to use a
	descriptive naming scheme. An example is using the first initial of every player round – turn and
	version info. For instance if nabiy, underdog, and drec were playing version 0.4.6 and it was Russia’s
	turn in the second round of play the name of the file should be: <b>nud2-1RS046.svg</b>
</p>
<h2><a id="sec_3">3.0</a> In Game Interface</h2>
<p>
	<b>* NOTE *</b> Due to TripleA being a turn based strategy engine, we
	cannot describe how the in game interface will be like since it is left
	up-to the developer's implementation. We will concentrate on one of the
	most popular mods that comes included with TripleA, "World War II v2 Revised".
</p>
<p>
	After starting a game, you will be faced with the main game window. A
	screen shot is provided below where various aspects of it will be discussed
	and explained.<br>

<h2><a id="sec_5">5.0</a> Unit Movement</h2>
<p>
	There are certain aspects to <u>movement</u> within the game, specifically two aspects.
	First, is the movement of the user with in the game. That is moving (or panning) around
	the map. Secondly, is the movement of the user's units after completing the first step.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Navigating the Map
		<ol>
			<li>Movement is allowed using the horizontal and vertical scroll bars</li>
			<li>Placing the mouse cursor at the edge of the map will also allow movement</li>
			<li>Right-Click and hold the right mouse button down, then drag the mouse around
			    the map. This is known as the &quot;drag scrolling&quot; feature of TripleA
			    implemented by lnxduk</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		Moving Units
		<ol>
			<li>Left-Click on the source territory once</li>
			<li>Move the mouse and left-click on the destination territory</li>
			<li>From the movement box that appears, select what units need to be moved</li>
			<li>When a movement path is undesirable somehow. One can forcefully specify
			    a custom route. It is done by conducting step 1, then right after instead
			    of proceeding to step 2; you right click once in each territory you want
			    your units to pass through. When that is done, we proceed to step 2 and
			    continue to step 3.</li>

<h2><a id="sec_6">6.0</a> Combat Engagements</h2>
<p>
	After the combat moves are laid out and ready. The next logical step is to engage in combat.
	The battles will all be laid out in the <b>Actions</b> tab on the right hand side of TripleA.
	They're laid out as a series of consecutive buttons, each button labeled with the name of the
	territory where a battle will be fought. Some battles are required that they be fought before
	others. Such is true with a combination of amphibious assaults and naval battles that occur
	in the same region. See figure 6.0.0 for an example of such a combination.

			This is an example of a battle to be held in Anglo-Egypt by the Germans vs. the British.

				<li>Amphibious combat from Sea Zone 15 to Egypt</li>
				<li>An extra battle in Karelia S.S.R</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			The battle on land for Egypt is listed first before the naval battle
			in Sea Zone 15 (this is because there is a British destroyer defending
			the Suez canal). It appears like this because we have moved the land troops
			in first before moving in the naval units. Either way, TripleA will pop-up
			a warning message notifying us that the battle in Sea Zone 15 must occur
			first before the land battle Egypt. If the naval battle goes well for the Germans
			then the amphibious assault will continue, if not, then the Germans are stuck
			without an amphibious assault.

<h2><a id="sec_8.1">8.1</a> Low Luck</h2>
<p>
	 Low luck is a methodology for rolling dice which reduces the variance inherent in
	 dice rolling. It guarantees that the number of hits in a certain set of rolls will
	 not differ from the average number of hits by more than one. The details of the
	 implementation as well as a general discussion of low luck can be found in the
	 DAAK club at <a href="http://www.daak.de/aarll/aarllregel.php?sprache=e">http://www.daak.de/aarll/aarllregel.php?sprache=e</a>.
</p>
<p>
	 The low luck option can be enabled by putting a check mark in the box next to
	 &quot;Low Luck&quot; in the properties tab before the game is started. This
	 option must be specified by the server in a multi player game. Low luck has
	 not been tested for PBEM games. The current implementation does not support
	 low luck rolling for SBR's or techs, instead normal rules are used in these
	 two cases. The number of dice rolled in a phase of a battle should never be
	 more than one. The number of hits will be indicated at the bottom of the
	 combat window and will be equal to the number of guaranteed hits plus one
	 if the only dice rolled is a hit. No dice may be rolled if the outcome is
	 guaranteed because no fractional dice are needed.<br>

<h2><a id="sec_9">9.0</a> F.A.Q</h2>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>I am using windows and I keep getting &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; what do I do?<br>
	<b>A: </B>You haven’t installed or set up the java virtual machine correctly. Go to <a href="#sec_1">Installing TripleA</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>I am a Linux or Mac OS X user and I keep getting &quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: games/strategy/engine/framework/GameRunner&quot;<br>
	<b>A: </b>This error occurs when there are no compiled classes for java to run. In other words, you might
	         have accidently downloaded the source package instead of the pre-compiled package.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>I get &quot;Unable to create server socket: Connection timed out: connect&quot;!<br>
	<b>A: </b>This basically means TripleA could not find the server to connect to. Are you behind
	a Firewall that is blocking you? Is the server behind a Firewall blocking your connections? Is
	your router set up properly for Port Forwarding? Or maybe the server went offline.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>No matter how many times I re-download TripleA, it keeps saying it is corrupted!<br>
	<b>A: </b>Try using a different UnZipping utility. If that doesn't work try re-downloading TripleA
	using a different program. There was a case where Mozilla browser kept saving the Zip file in a
	corrupted state.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>Don't ask me how.. but I can't seem to turn on the AI, how can I do it manually?<br>
	<b>A: </b>Visit this <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051026095937/http://maddlinks.com:80/triplea/index.php?showtopic=184">link</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>What can I do if I spot a SeaZone connection problem and want to fix it fast?<br>
	<b>A: </b>You can edit the XML game file manually as shown <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050824202924/http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php?showtopic=301">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>How do I report a bug?<br>
	<b>A: </b>Report bugs either on the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060823220623/http://maddlinks.com:80/triplea/">TripleA message board</a> or at the <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/triplea/">Project home page.</a>
	when doing so please follow this <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050519233122/http://maddlinks.com/triplea/index.php?showtopic=162">Bug Reporting guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Q: </b>Any way of getting an observer in the game?<br>
	<b>A: </b>Yes, by having the observer connect to your game and not selecting any countries.
	You can have many observers. One warning. They cannot leave during the middle of the game!
	If they do, it will halt the game and crash (not really crash but you guys would have to
	start over from a saved game).
