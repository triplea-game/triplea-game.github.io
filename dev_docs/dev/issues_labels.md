Labels are tags that help categorize issues. 
Admins can create or remove them to help categorize the issue queue at any given time.
They are pretty fluid as new categorizes of topics come up.
Below is a listing explaining what each label should mean.


### Bug Backlog
A code defect, something that is not working like it should

### Close Pending Confirmation
Waiting state before closing a problem to verify the issue has been addressed. This can mean that current conversation in the issue seems to be settled, or for code bugs it could mean that a PR is in flight with a code fix (in-flight means the code update has been tested and submitted, but not yet necessarily merged to master, the main game branch)

### Discussion
Marks an issue where the outcome is a discussion. There might be a decision to be made, more information desired, or a brain storming session about how a feature or process should work.

### Feature Backlog
A request for a new feature or an enhancement to existing functionality.

### Game Rules/Play
Tag to indicate the issue is about game rules, the mechanics of how the game is played.

### Infra/Code Backlog
A task or topic relating to the development coding infrastructure and code deployment pipeline.

###  Map Bug Backlog
Problems related to maps.

### Not Fixed / Ice Box
Issue was closed without adequate action. To be effective in working the ticket queue down, we need to keep things actionable and 'snappy'. Ideally we would fix all problems, but at some point, it's better to close an issue and just let it come up again. Important problems will have a tendency to come back up. Issues labelled with this are an admission of defeat, but it's also a way to focus effort away from potentially one-off problems to the larger issues that impact users more often.

### Performance
Topic related to game performance. This will generally be a 'this is a slow' type of ticket

### Process
Indicates a topic that is related just to process. The ticket will talk about the 'how' for any given topic. Generally these will be discussion topic, as we will be discussing strategies of how to accomplish / solve recurring tasks.

### UI Related
Ticket is related to the in-game graphics (user interface). Things like, 'button is in wrong location', or 'text size is small'.

### Major Bug
Indicates a high impacting bug, something we probably should fix before other bugs. For these issues, we cannot do something important, or the game is unplayable/corrupted.

###  WarClub Project
Grouping label for 'warclub project'. Essentially a project to consolidate and improve our website(s). As part of this, we need to make a few decisions about where various infrastructure components will go.
