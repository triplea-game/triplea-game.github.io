## Game compatibility testing

It is important to ensure that any proposed change does not break game compatibility (unless this has been previously agreed upon).  The following sections describe the tests that should be run to ensure game compatibility between a previously-released version (referred to below as **OLD**) and a branch containing a proposed change (referred to below as **NEW**).

### Save games

Ensure compatibility between save games generated by different versions.

##### Save game generated by NEW should be readable by OLD

1. Save game using NEW.
1. Load save game from (1) using OLD.

##### Save game generated by OLD should be readable by NEW

1. Save game using OLD.
1. Load save game from (1) using NEW.

### Network games

Ensure compatibility between network nodes running different versions.

##### Server running NEW should be able to communicate with client running OLD

1. Host a local network game using NEW.
1. Connect to game started in (1) using OLD.
    * Ensure OLD and NEW select players in adversarial roles.
1. Progress far enough in the game to fight a battle.

##### Lobby and bot running OLD should be able to communicate with client running NEW

1. Run a lobby with at least one bot using OLD.
    * This can be done locally or you can use the production lobby if a bot is available.
1. Connect to lobby started in (1) using NEW and start a game with bot.
    * Ensure OLD and NEW select players in adversarial roles.
1. Progress far enough in the game to fight a battle.
