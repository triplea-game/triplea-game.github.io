- Push Tag
  - Usage: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/.travis/push_tag#L13
    Description: write permission to triplea repo for creating a new tag on each release. 
      The tags are primarily for convenience, so we can relatively easily checkout a specific 
      version that we released. This is also a carry-over of the process TripleA used when
      hosted in SVN.
