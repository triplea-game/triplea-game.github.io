## Overview

An admin owned account used for automated build tasks that require repository write access.


## Personal Access Keys

- Travis automated releases key
  - Usage: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/.travis.yml#L32)
    Description: This key allows travis to push to github releases. It is set up by the
      travis ruby set up program when first configuring travis with triplea.
- Map Push Key
  - Usage: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/.travis/push_maps_yaml#L10
    Description: Write-Access to triplea github.io website repo to add map description files
- Push Tag
  - Usage: https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/blob/master/.travis/push_tag#L13
    Description: write permission to triplea repo for creating a new tag on each release. 
      The tags are primarily for convenience, so we can relatively easily checkout a specific 
      version that we released. This is also a carry-over of the process TripleA used when
      hosted in SVN.

The key values are recorded in travis as env variable values. They are write-once only. To regenerate them, regenerate the
key in github, delete the existing key in travis and recreate it with the newly known key value.
