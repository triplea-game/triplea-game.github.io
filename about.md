## About TripleA

TripleA was started in Oct 2001 by an unemployed Sean Bridges who was looking for a way to build up his resume after the end of the tech bubble. Unfortunately Sean was too successful, and soon after the 0.1 release (which he managed to demo in a job interview) he secured gainful employment.

Sean working full time dramatically slowed the progress of TripleA for a long time. Numerous people made contributions to the project, including both DMA02 and IronCross from a very early stage, but with Sean doing most of the development, and with the limited early graphics, the project did not improve dramatically.

TripleA would have continued on this slow trajectory, but two events occurring relatively closely revitalized the project. The first was the contribution by Logan of new graphics, giving the game a better look and feel. The second event was the release of the revised map and rules. With no competing real time game, interest in TripleA increased.

TripleA 0.3.1 was probably the first version that was really playable in networked mode. And since then, increasing community interest, and with great contributions from a number of people, TripleA continues to grow and prosper.
