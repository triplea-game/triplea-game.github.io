<p><b>Welcome to the world of dead reptiles and avian ancestors.</b></p>
<p><br>The map is a low resolution image produced from NASA topological data.</p>
<br>The globe was rotated to center Iceland on the equator before slicing it open and laying it flat.
<br>This reduces distortions for all land, since only water remains at the poles.
<br>A small section of turf around Greenland is used for JURASSIC.  Greenland's massive ice block makes it the perfect volcano for the Dimorphodon, one of the first Pterosaurs.
<br>This location is impassable and the capital of Tithonia.
<br>The players are named after the eleven periods of the Jurassic era.
<br>Their positions on the board make game play more or less difficult.
<br>This is reflected in the player list order with easiest on the bottom.
<br>The top player is unique with a special dinosaur; Dimorphodon.
<br>All other players have a full list of other dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period.
<br>The first player is meant to be a nuisance; a leftover from the Triassic.
<br>Even though the capital is impassable, you can still create but cannot return; like deamons emerging from the pit of Hell.
<br>
<br>The map is colored for topologic elevation and not actual vegetation conditions. Sea level after the last Ice Age, ten-thousand years ago, was nearly 400-feet lower than today.
<br>This is easy to see as the continental shelves (light blue areas). Sadly, all that topology has been washed clean.
<br>Territory Effects are employed to allow land reptiles to swim, and ocean dwellers to flop around on land.
<br>Study the Effects chart in the NOTES, or snap a screen shot and place it on your desktop for reference.
<br>Territories are labeled with a Terrain Tag. Combat is based on 12-sided dice.
<br>All creatures looking right are defense oriented.
<br>Each dinosaur has advantages, and the project purpose is to bring dinosaurs into the Triple-A family.
