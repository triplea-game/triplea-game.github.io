<br>Cold War 1965
<br>

<br>
<br>The Cold War... a period of great uncertainty. The 1960s saw the Berlin Wall go up, the Cuban Missile Crisis,
<br>the Sino-Soviet split, the Vietnam War, the Six Days War, the continued stand-off between the Koreas, tension between India and Pakistan,
<br>the end of European Colonialism (and the collapse of many successor states), and of course, the proliferation of nuclear arms.
<br>This was a tense period in our history, in which any number of small conflicts could have escalated quickly into WWIII.
