<br>The TripleA Map Image Extractor found in the 'Additional Utilities' folder can be used to re-create the map image by using the map's base tiles and
    pasting them together. Having the map image can help you later on when you are making a mod.
<br>The TripleA Map Resizer And Shifter found in the 'Additional Utilities' folder can be used to resize any map you choose by simply choosing the map,
    setting the scale amount or new dimensions, and having the program do the rest. You can also use it to shift the map by a specified amount.
