    An Anachronistic 20th century scenario based roughly on the years 1890-1914.
    3 Player version - First team to achieve 500 production wins.
    All territories have production capacity and units can be placed in any territory that you control. Each faction has a starting bid, with placement capped at the
    territories production value.
    In an AI game, the human player should save their bid as the computer.      Ships must be placed in sea zones that are adjacent to a controlled territory or island.
    This is a full alliance set up, but the map is designed to be edited.    Some friendly factions can be left to the AI if desired.
    More to come later.
           -Triplelk (Jason Clark) and Surtur
