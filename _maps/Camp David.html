<br>On 29 November 1947 the United Nations General Assembly approved a plan to resolve the Arab-Jewish conflict by
    partitioning Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. After the Arab rejection of this plan, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon
    and Syria invaded the territory of the former British Mandate of Palestine. The war concluded with the 1949 Armistice Agreements, but it
    did not mark the end of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Three more wars would follow.
<br>
<br>The Camp David map consists of the four Arab - Israeli wars:
<br>
<br>* 1948 Arab-Israeli War
<br>* 1956 Suez Crisis
<br>* 1967 Six-Day War
<br>* 1973 Yom Kippur War
<br>
