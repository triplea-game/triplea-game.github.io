mapName: NWO Variants
title: NWO Variants | TripleA Map
version: 1
---
<br>
<br>Includes 3 variants of New World Order
<br>
<br>1) NWO by Smallman.
<br>Map is designed to promote the faster units resulting in less stagnant stacks, and increased variety each game.
<br>Changes: Infantry, Transports, Submarines cost 1 more, Elites and Artillery 0.5 more, Mech.Inf and Katyusha cost 1 less.
<br>Finnland has 2 more EarlyFighters, Stalingrad 5 more Armour, and Paris has 1 more Bunker.
<br>
<br>2) NWO 5 Nation
<br>Same units as normal NWO, but with slightly changed territory values and only 5 nations: Germany and Italy against Russia, the UK, and USA.
<br>
<br>3) NWO Eastern Front by Penguins
<br>Fewer nations and fewer units than regular NWO, and the territories that were neutral in World War 2 are now impassible.
<br>
<br>You must have TripleA 1.5.x.x or later installed in order to use these game variants, as only triplea 1.5 or later come with "new_world_order" and the needed unit images.
