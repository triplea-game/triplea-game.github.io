<br>
<br>The War of the Relics is complex medieval-themed strategy game in which two players build factions of noble lords who use powerful titles and offices to gain strength and crush the opposition.
<br>Each lord can recruit sworn troops, mercenaries, druids, and ships to his cause, taking over castles and towns via title or conquest.
<br>Three sacred relics must be gathered to a player's faction to anoint one of its nobles as the new king.
<br>A system of random events can thwart the best-laid plans at the most inconvenient times.
