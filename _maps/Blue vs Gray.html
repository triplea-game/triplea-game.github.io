<br>Blue vs. Gray
<br>
<br>b.) Rough overview:
<br>A strategic-level Civil War scenario adapted from a simple-yet-elegant
<br>board game. Two players face off as the North and the South in the
<br>American Civil War of 1861-65. Each has control of infantry and
<br>cavalry units, which can be upgraded to stronger versions after
<br>winning battles. Three generals -- Lee, Grant, and Sherman -- are also
<br>featured. Players fight for control of territory with very different
<br>victory objectives.
<br>
<br>Much of the game is about maneuvering, as better position can trump
<br>superior firepower, and things evolve in surprising ways. A system for
<br>rail and river movement really mixes things up, and cavalry can jump
<br>over defenders to wreak havoc behind enemy lines.
<br>
<br>The North has lots of advantages, but the South has more ways to win,
<br>giving each side a distinct flavor.
<br>
<br>c) General tips:
<br>AI play is not possible; human-vs.-human play only, online or via email.
