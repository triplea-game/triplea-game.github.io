<br>WW1 mod of Domination map.
<br>
<br>Fall 1914. With the death of the Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, Europe is plunged into war.
<br>Titantic armies never seen before muster for battle.
<br>Colonial forces of the great powers skirmish around the world.
<br>Soldiers of all sides are told they will be home for Christmas.
<br>No one suspects they will battle for years over a few miles of no man's land.
