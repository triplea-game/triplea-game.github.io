<br>Suggestions to wgbt@gmx.at
<br>Game is continuously played by PBEM. Gamers state, that it is one of the best games listed at the depot.
<br>
<br>a.) Content:
<br>Includes 3 Mods of WAW.
<br>World at War Variant - v3 ... (with Japan as 2 parties Yamamoto and Hisaichi)
<br>World at War Variant - FUEL-AA-Range ... (with Japanese as only 1 combined party)
<br>World at War Variant - vXXX ... (with Japanese as only 1 combined party)
<br>
<br>b.) Rough overview:
<br>Detailed description inside game notes, following is a rough overview.
<br>
<br>All Variants use v3 rules and include:
<br>- paratroopers
<br>- air+sea+land transports, also landing boats, generally proper transport concept
<br>- construction unit
<br>- ability to destroy structures with strategic bombing raid (SBR)
<br>- destroy structures at a retreat
<br>- fighter escorting+intercepting and air battle before normal battle
<br>- battle rounds limit
<br>- multiple hitPoints
<br>- Turn order, which combines axis+allies parties and is therefore perfect for PBEM.
<br>
<br>The FUEL-AA-Range mod uses additional:
<br>- "Change unit owners" from Brit&US to Rus&CN and Rus to CN
<br>- Fighter scrambling with radar
<br>- Fighter can also do SBR to train, radar, construction and not intercepted planes
<br>- Fuel consumption for production+movement, incl. refineries
<br>- AntiAir (AA) separated to combat- (hit 1 of 6) and bombing raid- (hit 1 of 12) AA
<br>- Airbase enables full range for planes
<br>
<br>The vXXX mod uses additional:
<br>- Recruits
<br>- Slightly modified setup for this variant 
<br>- Ships SBR
<br>- Land units SBR
<br>
<br>c.) General tips:
<br>Due to the wide range of possibilities its more a game for experienced players (typical rounds 30).
<br>Specially the supply strategy is crucial for this mod with air+sea+land transport units.
<br>The combination of all possible features enables almost a real handling of warfare.
<br>The fuel mod opens a totally new strategy setup. Big unit groups can't move forever, so use your fuel wisely.
