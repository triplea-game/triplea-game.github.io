<br>Global War
<br>Created by Dagon81
<br>
<br>This has to be one of the best looking world maps I've seen.  Scale is a bit bigger than Big World and Ultimate World, but smaller than Domination.  Includes a v3
    rules version by veqryn.
<br>
<br>Filesize is huge, 33mb, so may take a while to download. External sf.net link used. If download does not work, please visit this website:
