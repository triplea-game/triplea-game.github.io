<br>Simplified version of the WWIIv5 1942 scenario, with fewer territories, starting units and income.
<br>Good for an easy game, and great for beginners.
<br>
<br>Changes:
<br>1. No strategic bombing.
<br>2. No AA Guns / Artillery / Cruisers.
<br>3. No shore bombardment.
<br>4. Cannot build new factories.
<br>5. Carrier and battleship costs decreased to 12 and 16 PUs.
<br>6. SZ18 (Black Sea) can't be accessed by ships.
