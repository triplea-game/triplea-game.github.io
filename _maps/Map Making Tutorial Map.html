<br>A VERY simple map.
<br>Purpose: use these files to make your first map.  If you can make a map out of it, then you can do anything.
<br>Basically, many people try to make these big elaborate maps as their very first map, and it often does not turn out well.  They get frustrated, have tons of bugs, and
    can't get the game to work (my very first map did not run either...).
<br>So the idea here is that you can take all these files, run them through the map creator, and in 20 minutes you will have a working map.  If you can make it work without bugs,
    and it runs, then you better understand the development process for maps and go apply what you learned here to the map you always wanted to make.
