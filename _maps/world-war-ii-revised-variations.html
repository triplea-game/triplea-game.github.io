<br>
<br>About the mods:
<br>
<br>   Hoshi Head: The Chinese and an Italian player were added to old WW-2-Revised map.
<br>
<br>   additional changes to Hoshi Head version:
<br>   - WW2v3 rules were added.
<br>   - all have paratroopers from the beginning on (how can that be a new technology?).
<br>   - Western Russia and Belorussia will be Russian after freed by any allies (because both belong to Russia and cannot be British or American).
<br>   - some territory's PU's were changed due to historical reasons.
<br>   Belorus: from 2 to 1 (what is there but villages and Minsk..?)
<br>   Archangelsk: from 2 to 1 (nothing but cold temperatures)
<br>   Borneo and East Indies: from 4 to 3 (Borneo cannot bring in more than India)
<br>   Novosibirsk: from 2 to 3 (very important industry region during WW2)
<br>   As a result, German starting PU's decreased from 30 to 29 and Japanese from 30 to 28.
