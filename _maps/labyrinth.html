    In Labyrinth, you assume the role of a reknowned adventurer trying to discover what is in the middle of this mysterious Labyrinth out in the middle
    of the Great Ocean. No one who enters ever returns, so speculation runs amok!

    This map features 8 character classes, hirable retainers, 4 resources, over 30 unique enemies and traps, and interactive map locations. There is
    also an inventory system although your items are on screen with your character and retainers and you have to move them with your entourage.
