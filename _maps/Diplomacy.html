<br>An adaptation of the game "Diplomacy" for TripleA.
<br>Includes 3 Free-For-All (ffa) games, and 1 normal
<br>
<br>1) Diplomacy
<br>This is as close as TripleA lets us come to the real Diplomacy board game. Uses some complex rules, be sure to read the game notes.
<br>
<br>2) Diplomacy: FFA V3 Rules
<br>This is the Diplomacy map of Europe, with ww2v3 units and rules.  Easy to learn.
<br>
<br>3) Diplomacy: FFA Great War Style
<br>This is the Diplomacy map of Europe, with "Great War" units.  Also very easy to learn.
<br>
<br>4) Diplomacy: WW1
<br>Unlike the other 3, this is a normal non-ffa game.  It pits Germany, Austria, and Turkey, against France, England, and Russia.  (Italy is neutral)
    It uses Diplomacy style units, Armies and Navies, with 3 territory types: Land, Sea, and Coastal.
