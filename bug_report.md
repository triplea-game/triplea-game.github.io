* <a href="https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug">Open Bug List</a>

## Filing a bug report:

* Createa a <a href="http://github.com/account"> github account</a>
* Submit a tracking issue: <a href="https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/new">https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/new</a>. Please feel free to create these liberally, they are relatively quick to close, and easy to re-open if there turns out to be done or discussed. Each issue will ideally end with a summary of what exactly needs to be done.
* 
When filling out bugs, please try to be as specific as possible. Please describe what is needed to create the situation where you see the bug, please specify what has gone wrong, and what you expected instead.
- be as concise and specific as you can
- describe the context of a problem, what do you need to do to trigger it, how do you set it up. Include any relevant files zipped to the tracking ticket, or include a link to the same files. Please keep in mind it may be some time before an issue is actually worked on
- describe what goes wrong, what is the problem as exactly as you can state it? Can be pretty simple sometimes: "Then this error pops up: (include contents of the error message, or if it's really long, you can create a github git to save it to and post a link to that: https://gist.github.com/)
- describe what you would have wanted to have happened, or what you were expecting. This helps keep us from guessing what the behavior should have been, so when we fix it, we know exactly how things "should" be.

The overall goal is to keep a tracking ticket so we can discuss and identify problems/features directions we are going. Secondly, an issue is most ideal when it is an isolated independent nugget, that someone can pick up, read, and really understand enough context of the problem and have directions to reproduce the problem, at which point they can immediately begin work.
