### Game Engine UI and Behavior
* Combat window auto-continues after a short delay when a dice roll results in all misses, or all units hit
* Improved missing map behavior when joining games, the game will still crash, but instead of an error message there is now a prompt asking if you would like to download the missing map. Clicking 'yes' will begin the missing map download.
* A new settings window is availabe from the game menu, some settings options have been moved there, and some new ones made available.

### AI Changes

### Map Changes

* Maps have been moved to Github, they will download faster, and map development can now be done with far less administrative support.
* Game engine will pick up map 'clones' from the downloaded maps folder. This means you can clone a map repo directly in the download maps, update it, play it, and then you can commit and push the changes to then update the main map repo. Map makers should no longer have to do any map zipping or unzipping.

* Removed "isCombatInfrastructure" and "unitDamage" from unit attachments, and also removed m_maxOperationalDamage from TripleAUnits. Unit damage is per unit, not per unit type, so it should never be a unit attachment. (veqryn [Mark Christopher Duncan])
