As of TripleA 1.9, downloading maps has become much easier. Since no maps come by default with the engine, it is imperative that you download some maps and get started playing right away.

## In-Game Download Process

Most of the time, you will want to play maps collected and curated by the developers of TripleA. These are easy to install using the process described below. If you wish to install other maps, see "Manual Map Installation."

1. Launch TripleA from the dock or its program, located by default at `/Applications/TripleA`. ![Main TripleA Screen with Download Maps button highlighted]({{ "/images/docs/triplea-main-screen.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
2. On the launch screen of TripleA, click "Download Maps," in the left-hand column. ![Main TripleA Screen with Download Maps button highlighted]({{ "/images/docs/triplea-maps-button-highlighted.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
3. A new window will open, listing the maps available for download. If this window does not open, check your network connection.

## Manual Map Installation

Manual installation of maps can be accomplished by moving them to the downloaded maps folder, which can be found at `~/Documents/triplea/downloadedMaps`. You do not need to unzip it if the zip file is working properly. If you have issues, try unzipping it.
