## FAQ

> Q. How do you set way points when moving.

A. Ctrl-click on the territory you want to use as a way point.


> Q. If the game is open source, how do you prevent people from hacking the dice.

A. In PBEM games, all dice are rolled by a third party dice server, and mailed to the players. This allows you to verify that your opponent is not cheating.

In online games, the dice are rolled on two computers, and are encrypted (for more details see OnlineDice ). If you are playing as a client (NOTE: if there are multiple clients, then only 1 client will have the verified random number), you can check the dice by using the menu games->show verified dice. If the dice in this window don't match the dice in the game, then the server has been hacked.


> Q. When I try to host a game, people cannot connect to me.

A. You are probably behind a router and/or a firewall. Read these for more details,

> Q. How do I open a port under Linux?

A. Using the root account (or sudo), at a command prompt type the following exactly, including capitalisation, spacing, and dashes. Note that in some places there is 1 dash and in other places there are 2 dashes:

`iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 3300 -j ACCEPT`

(If you want to open a different port, just replace the 3300 with the port number you want to open.)
