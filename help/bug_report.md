## Before doing anything

Before submitting a bug report at all, take a step back and make sure it's really a bug and not a feature request.
Feature Request often need to be discussed first, if you still want to submit your feature Request, please do so in [our Forum](https://forums.triplea-game.org/category/42/feature-requests-ideas).
If you are not sure if you are experiencing an actual bug, or it's just your own System which makes TripleA not work properly for you, [our community will be willingly to help](https://forums.triplea-game.org/category/10/help-questions).

## Filing a bug report

* Make sure that your bug wasn't already reported.
* Create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/account)
* Submit a tracking issue: <https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/issues/new>, you'll need to give the topic a title, and fill out a description of what you would like done.  Please try to be as concise and specific as you can. Always please try to give specific examples of problems, map names, etc., to help make it very easy to focus in directly on what the problem is.


## Handling bug reports
The overall goal is to keep a tracking ticket so we can discuss and identify problems/features, and pick them up as time and effort becomes available. Secondly, issue's tend to be most ideal when they are an isolated, bite-sized nugget. The hope is someone can pick up on up, read it quickly, and really understand enough context of the problem and have directions to reproduce the problem, at which point they can immediately begin work.
