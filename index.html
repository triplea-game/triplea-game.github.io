    <p>TripleA is a free online turn-based strategy board game engine, similar to such board games as Axis &amp; Allies or Risk. TripleA comes with several maps already installed and over 100 more <a href="{{ "/maps" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">can be downloaded from the user community</a>.</p>
    <p>TripleA supports single player vs AI, hot-seat, play by email and forum, and a hosted online lobby for live online play.</p>
    <p>A wide variety of maps allow one to recreate the Axis of World War II pushing towards Moscow, or devouring the Pacific, and the Allies desperately fighting back. Or play scenarios of Napoleon&rsquo;s march across Europe, Rome battling the Carthaginian Empire, Sauron conquering Middle Earth, or even Zombies taking over America!</p>
    <p>TripleA is Free Software, and is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>. <a href="{{ "/download" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Learn More</a> About the Installation Process</p>
