## How to Host a Bot

You need to first be sure your computer can be reached from the public internet.
See [how-to-host](/user-guide/how-to-host) for details.

To install and run a bot:

- Download the triplea-game-headless.zip file from [triplea releases](https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea/releases/latest)
- Extract the Zip file.
- The extracted zip file contains a `.bat` (for windows) and a `.sh` (for Mac and Linux) file that has properties for you to customize
- Once done configuring properties, run the `.bat` or `.sh` file and you should see your bot connected to the lobby
