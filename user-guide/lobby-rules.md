### General Rules

#### Use the golden rule, "Treat others as you would want to be treated.‚Äù

We have 5 rules written as follows, all players, including admins, must follow these simple 
rules when playing on  the lobby, in bots, and when using the forums;

* Follow the Golden Rule and treat others as you would like to be treated!

* No racism, sexism, and homophobic, or otherwise, vulgar language will be tolerated. 
The admins do not care if it does not offend you and/or your friends. No bullying and/or 
discrimination will be tolerated, that includes; Race, Religion, Sex, Age, Cultural Background, 
Sexual Orientation. Use of foul language, discrimination and derogatory comments are not acceptable, 
and are subject to admin disciplinary action. It is up to the admin to decide what is or is not 
acceptable in regards to defamation, discrimination and spamming.

* Due to the recent spat of BLATANT! racism in the lobby the TripleA Council has decided to increase 
the punishment for these offences to an instant 2 week Ban on first offense!

* No verbal abuse. Doing so violates rule #1 above.

* Listen to the admins and follow their instructions. The admins are here to help the community 
that you are playing on for free! Do what they say, and if you have a complaint, do it in a civil 
manner on the forums here. Disobeying an admin can result in you being disciplined by the admins, 
up to and including being kicked from the game, or temporarily/permanently being banned. We have a 
thread to lodge complaints, so use it and keep it out of the Lobby.

* Please watch your language - there are underage children playing in the lobby, would you want 
your younger brother/sister/cousin being exposed to the kind of language you're using? Keep it 
clean when you get upset, take a breather before expressing your feelings in the Lobby and please 
refrain from swearing.

Our general policy in regards to breaking the rules is: Warn, Mute, Kick, Day-Ban, Perm Ban. 
Depending on the seriousness of the issue, you may be insta-day-banned (remember rule #2.) 
Furthermore, repetitive bad behavior can result in a perm ban, whether its twice or 10 times, 
it is up to the admins.


### Banning Information

If you have been banned, and wish to either lodge a complaint or make a case for your un-ban, 
please go to this thread. Banned players: Please keep personal feelings and attitudes out of your 
posts. Be professional and clear, try to give any information possible. Unless you are the banned 
user, banning admin, or another admin involved, we ask that you do not post unnecessarily.

### Lobby and Bot Rules

Again the General Rules above apply to the Lobby as well to the bots. The bots are not private 
rooms and the Admin are also moderating the bots. Admins have the right to take action upon you, 
if you are found in breach of these rules.

If you feel an admin has abused players or violated the rules, please PM another admin or post 
in forums. Do not post a thread for flamebait. Be professional and take a screenshot and let another 
admin know what has happened.

If an admin requests something such as, name changing, language control, etc, we ask that all 
players adhere to them. Admins make the decisions on kicking, banning, etc. Admins may or may 
not respond to questions regarding the decision, again if you have a complaint, read above.

Admins will keep a record of any action taken including the user involved, the reason, and 
hopefully a screenshot of the incident.

Excessive language, discrimination or openly defacing Lobby admins, Forum mods, and other 
users can result in being IP banned.

Donations and other favors do not exempt you from following the lobby rules, and does not 
limit or prevent the mods from taking any actions, including mutes or bans, against you.

### Usernames Rules

Please choose your username with care so it don't offend anybody. If a mod asks you to 
change your username, please change your name. Non-compliance will result in a boot and 
eventually in a ban from the server.

The following usernames are explicit not allowed:

- Names which contains vulgar language
- Names with sexual or racial connotations
- Names with a political or religious or ideological agenda
- Names which impersonate another player or a mod and names which are made solely to harass, 
troll or annoy another player or a mod.
- TripleA is a wargame and the names of the protagonist of the different warscenarios hosted 
by the server are allowed. But names that diminish and trivialize or even gloriefies warcriminals 
or warcrimes are not allowed.
- Names that are found to be very offensive

### Conclusion

For minor offenses, we ask you to please stop immediately. General policy is a warn, then kick,
 then day-ban. Deliberate ignorance of our warnings can result in a ban from the Lobby.

If a user has been found to directly target a person in a server, they will be removed. If a
 user comes onto the Lobby and verbally abuses other players, we can ban them. If a user 
 continues to hassle our players, and/or admins, we will take disciplinary action against you,
  which is depending on the severity of your action.

Remember our Golden Rule is to treat others the same way you would want to be treated. TripleA 
is one of the greatest Axis and Allies games and community. We want everyone to enjoy their
 time here, so please keep it clean and have fun!
