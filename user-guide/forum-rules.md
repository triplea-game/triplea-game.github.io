### Forum Rules

The [Lobby Rules](/user-guide/lobby-rules) apply to all of our forums.

Posting of links to websites and information that are discriminatory, derogatory, vulgar, 
or included sexual content will be edited. Do not post your personal information in the forums, use email.

Moderators of the forums have the responsibility of cleaning up and looking after the forums. 
If you feel you have been abused by a user or admin in a forum, please PM another admin.

All messages posted are to be civil. Lewd conduct on our forums (swearing, name calling or other 
abusive type behavior) will not be tolerated, and offending users can be banned from the forums. Again, follow the golden rule and treat others as you would like to be treated!
